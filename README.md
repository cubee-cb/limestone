---

anyway i'd call this a "horde defence" game

it's like if vampire survivors was a platformer but also had a tower to defend

takes elements from the following:
- Vampire Survivors
    - points from enemies
    - "store" with upgrades
- Bloons TD
    - lives and leak rules
    - round structure
- Towerfall
    - randomised entrances
- References
    - Gunboots
        - Based on Downwell's gunboots
    - Nemesis
        - Cave Story: weapon of the same name, and hat
            - needs the points to reduce its power or something to pay homage to the weapon properly
        - Laser Bird (old prototype): laser projectile
    - Charge Dash
        - Visual is based on Sonic's spin dash
    - Revolver
        - It's specifically the one from BEATWISE TRIGGER
    - Spectral Impulse
        - Based on Lilith's spirit power from 20 Minutes Till Dawn.
        - behaves like the Demond Ghosts from New Game+ mode in Ninja Cat Remewstered.
    - Blade Aura
        - Maelstrom ability brom Bloons Tower Defence.
    - Big Rock
        - Yuuto Ichika's boulder from Super Ledgehop: Double Laser (+ her Rivals of Aether mod)
    - Telefragger
        - Functionality based on Quake's telefrags and Sonic's Homing Attack.
            - It only "telefrags" enemies with less health that it does damage, but it has high damage to compensate.
        - Item graphic loosely based on Terrors of Nowhere's teleporter and the Gamblecore machine's button.
    - Strobe enemy
        - Head is based on the Sun from Oneshot.
